- Deep learning models perform are believed to perform better than traditional models like ARIMA ,ARMA ..and machine learning models for time series forecast especially for data that has complex structure, and high variance .
- The main goal of this project was to discover the architecture of an LSTM model , and why it performs better than traditional ones .
